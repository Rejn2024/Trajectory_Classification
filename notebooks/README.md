# Dataset-generation notebooks

Start with `01_generate_smoke_dataset.ipynb`. It is intentionally executable without
BVR Sim: a small deterministic dynamics stub exercises the repository's real scenario
sampler, policies, episode runner, feature generation, manifest, and Parquet writer.
This makes it possible to validate the data contract before connecting an external
simulator.

The generated files default to `artifacts/datasets/bvr_f16_1v1_smoke_demo/` and are
safe to delete. Set `BVR_NOTEBOOK_OUTPUT` to write elsewhere. When BVR Sim is installed
at the pinned revision, replace only the `env_factory` shown near the end of the
notebook; keep the validation and persistence cells unchanged.

For a simulator-backed pilot, use `02_generate_jsbsim_skill_dataset.ipynb`. It runs
100 seeded 1-v-1 flights through JSBSim, selects labelled behaviours through BVR
Sim's `SkillManager` and a reproducible stochastic schedule manager, records canonical
features at 10 Hz, and emits one Tacview ACMI replay per flight. Use
`BVR_DATASET_FLIGHTS` for a shorter validation run before the full build. Flights run in
spawn-compatible loky worker processes on Windows and POSIX; set `BVR_DATASET_WORKERS=1`
to run serially while debugging. Install the `video` extra before running this notebook.

Train a skill classifier with `03_train_jsbsim_skill_classifier.ipynb`. It reads the
canonical Parquet shards from notebook 02, splits complete flights between
train/test/validation (approximately 60%/20%/20%) while stratifying on every skill
demonstrated in a flight, then constructs five-second windows and fits normalization
on the training split only. It trains a Transformer classifier, uses test loss for
checkpoint selection, reserves validation for the final report, and records parameters,
metrics, and artifacts with MLflow. Set `BVR_TRAIN_DATASET` to load a dataset from a
non-default location. By default, MLflow stores tracking data in
`artifacts/mlflow.db` using its SQLite backend; set `BVR_MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` to use a
different database or tracking server.

If Parquet loading fails with `ArrowKeyError: No type extension with name
arrow.py_extension_type found`, update the environment with `pip install -e '.[ml]'`,
restart the notebook kernel, and run all cells again. The project requires
PyArrow 14.0.1 or newer because 14.0.1 includes PyArrow's own legacy-extension
hotfix; restarting clears any partially imported pandas modules from the old session.

Train the hybrid-action reinforcement-learning pilot with
`04_train_rl_pilot.ipynb`. The notebook runs the production `PPOTrainer` against a fast,
deterministic backend that implements the documented simulator contract, then plots return
and PPO loss and inspects an evaluation rollout. This makes the complete training,
checkpointing, MLflow, and diagnostics path reproducible without a native simulator. Replace
only the notebook's backend factory to connect JSBSim/BVR Sim. Configure the example with
`BVR_PILOT_EPOCHS`, `BVR_PILOT_EPISODE_SECONDS`, `BVR_PILOT_DEVICE`, and
`BVR_PILOT_OUTPUT`.
